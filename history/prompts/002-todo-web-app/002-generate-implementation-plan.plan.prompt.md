# Generate Phase 2 Web App Implementation Plan

As the AI assistant, your task is to create a detailed implementation plan for the Phase 2 Web Application based on the generated specification. Break down the development process into logical phases and smaller, manageable tasks. For each task, suggest the technologies to be used, potential challenges, and dependencies.

The plan should cover:
*   Project setup and environment configuration.
*   Frontend architecture (components, routing, state management).
*   Integration with backend APIs (authentication, task management).
*   Styling and responsiveness.
*   Testing strategies.
*   Deployment considerations.
