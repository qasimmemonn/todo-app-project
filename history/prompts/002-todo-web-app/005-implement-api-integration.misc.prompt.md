# Implement API Integration for Phase 2 Web App

As the AI assistant, integrate the Phase 2 Web Application with the backend APIs for authentication and task management. Your tasks include:
1.  **Authentication API:** Implement service functions to handle user registration, login, and logout by making API calls to the specified endpoints (e.g., `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`). Manage access tokens and user session state.
2.  **Task API:** Implement service functions for CRUD operations on tasks (fetch all tasks, create new task, update task, delete task) by interacting with the `/tasks` API endpoints.
3.  Ensure robust error handling and proper data serialization/deserialization for all API interactions.
