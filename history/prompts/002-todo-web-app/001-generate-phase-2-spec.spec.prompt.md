# Generate Phase 2 Web App Specification

As the AI assistant, your task is to generate a comprehensive specification document for the Phase 2 Web Application. This document should detail the functional and non-functional requirements, key features, user authentication flows, task management functionalities (CRUD operations), UI/UX considerations, and proposed technologies (e.g., React, TypeScript).

The specification should be clear, concise, and serve as a guiding document for the development team. It should cover aspects similar to what was done for the Phase 1 Console Application, but adapted for a web-based interface.
